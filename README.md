HandsMen Threads â€“ Elevating the Art of Sophistication in Men's Fashion

This repository contains the complete implementation and documentation for the Salesforce Capstone Project.

### Overview
The objective of this project is to design and implement a scalable Salesforce solution that centralizes all business data, enforces data integrity directly from the user interface, and automates key business processes to improve customer experience and operational efficiency. Specifically, the solution delivers automated order confirmations, a dynamic loyalty program driven by purchase history, proactive stock alerts when inventory runs low, and scheduled bulk order updates that reconcile finances and inventory each night.
